Ambulance service simulation with threads

Compile:
javac -cp "." *.java

Run:
java -cp "." Main

How it works:

Ambulance service simulates hospital, which will send ambulances to incidents happening in the city.
Incindent work in their own threads and can happen simultaneously. Hospital will send ambulance to incident if there is one waiting,
otherwise it waits until one gets back from previous incident.
Will calculate average and total amount of time spent in incident per iteration and 
in the end prints the best iterations of both.

Run the program, it will ask for how many iteration you want to run.
All other variables are generated by program (randomized).

Affecting variables

Per iteration:
- City size (50-100), so at max -100,100 in x and y.
- Hospital location, limits to city size
- Amount of ambulances in hospital (1-5)
- Amount of incidents that will happen in iteration (1-10)

Per incident
- Speed of the ambulance (5-15), 
- Location of incident, limits to city size
- Launch time, program will fire them randomly


Problems/Things to note:
- Ambulance speed should perhaps be same per iteration, but it wasnt specified in assignment
- Program does not take priority in incidents, ie incindents that launched earlier might have to wait longer than newer indcidents
- Sometimes ambulance id is might be shown wrong, though it is just visual
